# Where is ...? (Where is waldo)
### Description
This game is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The idea is to make a game based on Where is Waldo and learn how to work with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a Baas in a real project.<br />
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.<br />
In this version you will have to find tree random characters in the image.
